You've stumbled upon my blog and portfolio. Right now there's not that much here yet, I'm simply testing out the deployment workflow to get this webpage served.

At this point in time, Google's cloud run looks to be by far the best option. I'm a certified GCP engineer, so I know my way around and the scaling to 0 is just so useful! Having just a static site, the cold start is also not that big of a factor because spinning up a container that size is peanuts.

That said, Google doesn't like my PayPal and is blocking every attempt from me to try and make it right, sending me all over the place through their documentation, but not a chat support window in sight. So I guess they don't want my money then! After way too much time searching around, DigitalOcean it is :)

I'm thinking of 2 specific blogposts to start with. One to show how to deal with Proximus billing and another on what type of carsharing to choose!
