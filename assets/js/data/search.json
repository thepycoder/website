Not only is the last jekyll docker image from 8 months ago at the time of writing, there’s plenty of annoyances in building the Dockerfile.# Pick a previous version, because 4+ had issuesFROM jekyll/jekyll:3.8.6# The docker images uses a normal user instead of root (which is good), but that also means you can&#39;t just put everything in /app because the permissions are all fucked up then. Took me a while this one.RUN git clone https://github.com/thepycoder/website.git /srv/websiteWORKDIR /srv/websiteEXPOSE 4000# Now here&#39;s where permissions are fucking in a cryptic way for me. Don&#39;t know why I need it, but I need it and I hate it.RUN touch Gemfile.lockRUN chmod a+w Gemfile.lock# Same with this junk, if we don&#39;t create the folders ourselves, stuff crashes on permission errors...RUN mkdir _site .jekyll-cacheRUN jekyll buildDigital Ocean App PlatformDigital Ocean has a free tier in their app platform that allows you to host 3 static sites for free. It has nice integration with Github, so no need for setting up actions. The only thing we need to do is to create the Dockerfile that generates the static site files and point digital ocean to it!To get it up and running create a new app and link it to your github or gitlab account. I only allow access to my website repo.Then select your repo and branch name and leave auto deploy on. This is really handy as it will generate our site and update it every time we push to our selected branch.In the next step, edit Type and select a static website. Then edit the output folder to the _site of your jekyll folder within the container. Now just choose a name and you should be good to go!DigitalOcean will build the container every commit to the selected branch and then get all the static files from a specified folder in the container. It will then serve that. Pretty neat!" }, { "title": "Welcome!", "url": "/posts/welcome/", "categories": "Fluff", "tags": "", "date": "2022-03-04 17:56:00 +0000", "snippet": "You’ve stumbled upon my blog and portfolio. Right now there’s not that much here yet, I’m simply testing out the deployment workflow to get this webpage served.At this point in time, Google’s cloud run looks to be by far the best option. I’m a certified GCP engineer, so I know my way around and the scaling to 0 is just so useful! Having just a static site, the cold start is also not that big of a factor because spinning up a container that size is peanuts.That said, Google doesn’t like my PayPal and is blocking every attempt from me to try and make it right, sending me all over the place through their documentation, but not a chat support window in sight. So I guess they don’t want my money then! After way too much time searching around, DigitalOcean it is :)I’m thinking of 2 specific blogposts to start with. One to show how to deal with Proximus billing and another on what type of carsharing to choose!" } ]
